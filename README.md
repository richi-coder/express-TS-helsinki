# Simple Express app using Typescript to understand how types and other utilities can be an advantage for coding

Clone the project, run npm install and start creating http requests (get and post) with your own client method.

When posting, data is only saved to memory (not at any database or similar).
For checking post requests, I left a console.log line at routes/diaries.ts in the post function. The printed message appears in the command line.

Get requests are easier to check. Only fetch to localhost:3000/api/diaries or localhost:3000/api/diaries/1. It can be 1, 2, 3 or 4.

Thanks!
